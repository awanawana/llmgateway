## Simpler Pricing, More Value

We're retiring the Pro plan and making all its features available to everyone for free. No more complicated tiers — just straightforward, transparent pricing.

### What's Now Free for Everyone

**Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)**

Use your own API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and 60+ other providers. Pay providers directly with just a 1% tracking fee from us.

**Team Management**

Invite up to 5 team members and manage roles and permissions. Need more seats? Just reach out.

**Extended Limits**

- 20 API keys per project (up from 5)
- 10 projects per organization (up from 3)
- 30-day data retention (up from 3 days)

**Advanced Analytics**

Full access to real-time cost and latency analytics. Monitor usage across all providers in one dashboard.

**Auto-routing & Caching**

Automatic provider routing for optimal performance. Prompt caching for faster responses and lower costs.

### New Simplified Pricing

**Credits**: Flat 5% platform fee — no hidden processing fees

**BYOK**: 1% tracking fee when using your own API keys

That's it. Simple and transparent.

### For Existing Pro Subscribers

Your subscription will be cancelled automatically. All your features stay exactly the same — they're just free now.

### Need More?

For custom SLAs, dedicated infrastructure, higher limits, or priority support, our Enterprise plan has you covered. Contact us at contact@llmgateway.io.
