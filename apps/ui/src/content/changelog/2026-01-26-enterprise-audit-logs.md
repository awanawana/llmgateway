**Audit Logs** give you complete visibility into all actions within your organization.

## What's Tracked

Every significant action is logged with:

- **Timestamp** — when the action occurred
- **User** — who performed the action
- **Action** — what was done (create, update, delete)
- **Resource** — which resource was affected (API keys, projects, team members, etc.)
- **Details** — additional context like resource names

## Features

- **Cursor-based pagination** — efficiently browse through thousands of logs
- **Filtering** — filter by action type, resource type, or user
- **Copyable resource IDs** — quickly copy IDs for reference
- **Mobile-friendly** — works seamlessly on all devices

## Access

Audit logs are available on the **Enterprise plan** for organization owners and admins.
