**Agent Skills** are structured guidelines for AI coding agents, optimized for use with LLM Gateway and the AI SDK. They provide best practices and reusable instructions that help AI agents generate higher-quality code.

## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are packaged sets of rules and guidelines that teach AI coding agents how to implement specific features correctly. Each skill covers:

- API integration patterns
- Frontend rendering best practices
- Error handling strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

## Available Skills

### Image Generation

The Image Generation skill teaches AI agents how to properly implement image generation features:

- **API Integration** — correctly calling image generation APIs
- **Frontend Rendering** — displaying generated images efficiently
- **Error Handling** — graceful degradation and retry logic
- **Performance** — caching, lazy loading, and optimization

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js 18+ and pnpm 9+ installed:

```bash
node --version  # v18.0.0 or higher
pnpm --version  # 9.0.0 or higher
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theopenco/agent-skills.git
cd agent-skills
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Build Skills

Build all skills to generate the documentation:

```bash
pnpm build:all
```

Or build a specific skill:

```bash
pnpm build
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Using Skills in Your Project

After building, each skill generates an `AGENTS.md` file that can be used with AI coding agents like Claude, Cursor, or Copilot.

### With Claude Code

Add the generated `AGENTS.md` content to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file:

```bash
cat skills/image-generation/AGENTS.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

### With Cursor

Add the skill content to your `.cursorrules` file:

```bash
cat skills/image-generation/AGENTS.md >> .cursorrules
```

### With Other AI Agents

Most AI coding tools support custom instructions. Copy the skill content into your tool's configuration.

### Adding New Rules

<Steps>
<Step>
### Fork and Clone

Fork the repository and create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/new-rule
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Rule File

Rules follow a standardized template with YAML frontmatter containing `title`, `impact` (high/medium/low), and `tags`. The body includes sections for Context, Incorrect examples, and Correct examples with TypeScript code blocks.

See existing rules in `skills/image-generation/rules/` for reference.

</Step>

<Step>
### Validate and Build

```bash
pnpm validate
pnpm build:all
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Submit a Pull Request

Push your changes and open a PR.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Impact Levels

When creating rules, use these impact levels:

- **high** — Critical for correctness or security
- **medium** — Important for quality and maintainability
- **low** — Nice-to-have improvements
