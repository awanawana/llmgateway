The Provider Keys page lets you add your own API keys from LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) to route requests directly through your accounts without additional gateway fees.

## Adding a Provider Key

Click **Add Provider Key** to configure a new key:

- **Provider** — Select which provider this key belongs to
- **Custom name** — An optional label to identify the key
- **API key** — Your provider's API key
- **Base URL** — Optional custom endpoint (useful for Azure OpenAI or custom deployments)

## Provider Keys List

Each configured key shows:

| Field           | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provider**    | The LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)         |
| **Custom name** | Your label for the key                             |
| **Status**      | Active, inactive, or deleted                       |
| **Base URL**    | Custom endpoint if configured                      |
| **Token**       | Masked key with only the last 4 characters visible |

## Actions

For each provider key:

- **Edit** — Update the key name, value, or base URL
- **Deactivate** — Temporarily disable the key without deleting it
- **Delete** — Permanently remove the key
