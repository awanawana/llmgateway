The Preferences page contains project-level settings that control how your project behaves.

{/* ![Preferences](/learn/preferences.png) */}

## Project Name

Update the display name for your project. This name appears in the sidebar and throughout the dashboard.

## Project Mode

Configure how your organization handles projects. This setting determines the routing and isolation behavior for API requests within the project.

## Caching

Enable or configure response caching for API requests. When enabled, identical requests will return cached responses instead of making new calls to the provider, saving both time and cost.

Learn more about caching in the [Caching feature docs](/features/caching).

## Danger Zone

The Danger Zone section contains irreversible actions:

- **Archive Project** — Permanently archive the project. This action cannot be undone. Archived projects stop processing requests and their API keys become inactive.
