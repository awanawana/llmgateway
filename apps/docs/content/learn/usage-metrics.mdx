## Filters

- **API Key** — Filter metrics by a specific API key or view all
- **Date range** — Select the time period (defaults to last 7 days)

## Tabs

### Requests

A time-series chart showing request volume over the selected period. Use this to identify traffic patterns, peak usage times, and growth trends.

### Models

A table showing your top-used models ranked by request count. For each model you can see:

- Total requests
- Token consumption
- Associated costs

This helps you understand which models drive the most usage and cost.

### Errors

A chart showing error rates over time. Track:

- Error frequency and trends
- Spikes that may indicate provider issues
- Overall reliability of your API calls

### Cache

A chart showing your cache hit rate over time. Monitor:

- How effectively caching is reducing redundant requests
- Cache hit vs. miss ratios
- The cost savings from cached responses

### Costs

A cost breakdown chart showing spending patterns. Analyze:

- Cost trends over time
- Cost distribution by provider or model
- Opportunities to reduce spending
