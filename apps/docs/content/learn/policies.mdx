## Data Retention

Control how long your request logs and activity data are stored. The retention period depends on your plan:

| Plan           | Retention Period |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Free**       | 3 days           |
| **Pro**        | 7 days           |
| **Enterprise** | 90 days          |

After the retention period expires, request logs and associated data are automatically deleted.

Learn more about data retention in the [Data Retention feature docs](/features/data-retention).
