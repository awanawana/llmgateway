## Filters

Narrow down the log entries:

- **Action** — Filter by action type (create, delete, update, etc.)
- **Resource type** — Filter by resource (API, IAM, API Keys, etc.)

Both filters are populated dynamically based on the actions recorded in your organization.

## Audit Log Entries

Each log entry shows:

| Field             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Timestamp**     | Exact time of the action (formatted as MMM d, yyyy HH:mm:ss) |
| **User**          | Name and email of the person who performed the action        |
| **Action**        | What was done (e.g., "API Keys → create")                    |
| **Resource type** | The type of resource affected (shown as a badge)             |
