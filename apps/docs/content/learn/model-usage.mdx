The Model Usage page shows how your API requests are distributed across different LLM models over time.

## Filters

Two filters let you narrow down the data:

- **API Key** — Select a specific API key or view usage across all keys
- **Date range** — Choose a time period to analyze

## Usage Chart

The main chart displays a time-series breakdown of requests per model. Each model is represented by a different color, making it easy to see:

- Which models are used most frequently
- How usage patterns change over time
- Whether usage is concentrated on a single model or spread across many

This page is useful for understanding your model distribution and identifying opportunities to optimize costs by switching to more cost-effective models for certain workloads.
