## Credits

Displays your current credit balance. Credits are consumed as you make API requests through the gateway. Click **Top Up Credits** to add more credits to your account.

## Plan Management

View and manage your subscription:

- See your current plan (Free, Pro, or Enterprise)
- Billing cycle information
- Click **Manage Subscription** to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel

## Payment Methods

Manage your saved payment methods:

- Add a new credit card or payment method
- View existing payment methods
- Update billing information

## Auto Top-up Settings

Configure automatic credit top-ups so you never run out:

- **Enable/disable** auto top-up
- **Threshold** — The credit balance that triggers a top-up
- **Amount** — How many credits to add when the threshold is reached

This ensures uninterrupted service by automatically replenishing your credits when they run low.
