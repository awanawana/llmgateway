</Callout>

## Main Toggle

A global toggle at the top enables or disables all guardrails for your organization. Click **Save Changes** to apply.

## System Rules

Six built-in rules with individual enable/disable toggles:

| Rule                            | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Injection Detection**  | Detects attempts to override or manipulate system instructions       |
| **Jailbreak Prevention**        | Identifies attempts to bypass safety measures                        |
| **PII Detection**               | Identifies personal information like emails, phone numbers, and SSNs |
| **Secrets Detection**           | Detects API keys, passwords, and credentials                         |
| **File Type Restrictions**      | Controls which file types can be uploaded                            |
| **Document Leakage Prevention** | Detects attempts to extract confidential documents                   |

Each rule has an action dropdown to configure the response:

- **Block** — Reject the request entirely
- **Redact** — Remove or mask sensitive content, then continue
- **Warn** — Log the violation but allow the request

## File Restrictions

Configure file upload limits:

- **Max file size** — Set the maximum file size in MB
- **Allowed file types** — Add or remove permitted MIME types

## Custom Rules

Create organization-specific rules by clicking **Add Rule**:

- **Blocked Terms** — Block specific words or phrases
- **Custom Regex** — Match patterns with regular expressions
- **Topic Restriction** — Restrict content related to specific topics

Each custom rule can be individually enabled/disabled or deleted.
