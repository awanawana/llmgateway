## Eligibility

To unlock the referral program, your organization must have at least **$100 in total credit top-ups**. Before reaching this threshold, the page shows:

- A progress bar showing your progress toward $100
- The remaining amount needed to unlock
- An explanation of the 1% earnings model

## Referral Dashboard

Once eligible, the page shows:

### Your Referral Link

A unique shareable link tied to your organization. Click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard and share it with others.

### Your Stats

| Stat               | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users Referred** | Total number of users who signed up through your link |
| **Total Earnings** | Total credit amount earned from referrals             |

### How It Works

1. **Share Your Link** — Send your referral link to others
2. **They Sign Up** — They create an LLM Gateway account using your link
3. **Earn Credits** — You earn 1% of their spending as credits

Credits are automatically added to your organization balance.
