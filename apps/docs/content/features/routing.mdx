# Routing

LLMGateway provides flexible and intelligent routing options to help you get the best performance and cost efficiency from your AI applications. Whether you want to use specific models, providers, or let our system automatically optimize your requests, we've got you covered.

## Model Selection

### Any Model Name

You can use any model name from our [models page](https://llmgateway.io/models) or discover available models programmatically through the [/v1/models endpoint](/v1_models).

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Model ID Routing

Choose a specific model ID to route to the **best available provider** for that model. LLMGateway's smart routing algorithm considers multiple factors to find the optimal provider across all configured options.

#### Smart Routing Algorithm

When you use a model ID without a provider prefix, LLMGateway's intelligent routing system analyzes multiple factors to select the best provider:

**Weighted Scoring System** (based on last 5 minutes of metrics):

- **Uptime (50%)** - Prioritizes providers with high reliability and low error rates
- **Throughput (20%)** - Favors providers with higher tokens per second generation speed
- **Price (20%)** - Considers cost efficiency while maintaining quality
- **Latency (10%)** - Considers time to first token (uses reasoning token time when available)

The algorithm calculates a weighted score for each available provider and selects the one with the lowest (best) score. All metrics are normalized to ensure fair comparison across providers.

**Epsilon-Greedy Exploration** (1% of requests):

To solve the "cold start problem" where new or unused providers never get traffic to build up metrics, the system randomly explores different providers 1% of the time. This ensures:

- All providers periodically receive traffic
- New providers can prove their reliability
- The system adapts to changing provider performance
- You benefit from improved routing decisions over time

**Routing Metadata**:

Every request includes detailed routing metadata in the logs, showing:

- Available providers that were considered
- Selected provider and selection reason
- Scores for each provider (including uptime, throughput, latency, and price)

This transparency allows you to understand and debug routing decisions.

<Callout type="info">
	Using model IDs without a provider prefix automatically routes to the optimal
	provider based on reliability, speed, and cost. The system continuously learns
	and adapts based on real-time performance metrics.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
	Smart routing prioritizes reliability over cost, ensuring your requests are
	routed to providers with proven uptime and performance, while still
	considering cost efficiency.
</Callout>

### Provider-Specific Routing

To use a specific provider without any fallbacks, prefix the model name with the provider name followed by a slash:

```bash
# Use OpenAI specifically
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'

# Use the CloudRift provider specifically
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "cloudrift/deepseek-v3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

#### Low-Uptime Protection

When you specify a provider explicitly, LLMGateway checks the provider's recent uptime (last 5 minutes). If the uptime falls below 90%, the system automatically routes your request to the best available alternative provider to ensure reliability. This protects your application from providers experiencing temporary issues.

<Callout type="info">
	If the requested provider has low uptime but no alternative providers are
	available for that model, the request will still be sent to the originally
	requested provider.
</Callout>

If you need to bypass this protection and always use the exact provider you specified regardless of its current uptime, this can be configured in your project settings (coming soon).

## Optimized Auto Routing

Auto routing automatically selects the best model for your specific use case without you having to specify a model at all.

### Current Implementation

The auto routing system currently:

- **Chooses cost-effective models** by default for optimal price-to-performance ratio
- **Automatically scales to more powerful models** based on your request's context size
- **Handles large contexts intelligently** by selecting models with appropriate context windows

```bash
# Let LLMGateway choose the optimal model
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Your request here..."}]
  }'
```

### Free Models Only

When using auto routing, you can restrict the selection to only free models (models with zero input and output pricing) by setting the `free_models_only` parameter to `true`:

```bash
# Auto route to free models only
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "free_models_only": true
  }'
```

<Callout type="success">
	Adding even a small amount of credits to your account (e.g., $5) will
	immediately upgrade your free model rate limits from 5 requests per 10 minutes
	to 20 requests per minute.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
	The `free_models_only` parameter only works with auto routing (`"model":
	"auto"`). If no free models are available that meet your request requirements,
	the API will return an error.
</Callout>

### Reasoning models only

Just specify the `reasoning_effort` value and only a model which supports reasoning will be chosen. This parameter is not specific to the auto model.

```bash
# Auto route only to reasoning models
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "reasoning_effort": "medium"
  }'
```

### Exclude Reasoning Models

When using auto routing, you can exclude reasoning models from selection by setting the `no_reasoning` parameter to `true`. This is useful when you want faster responses or need to avoid the additional cost and latency of reasoning models:

```bash
# Auto route excluding reasoning models
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "no_reasoning": true
  }'
```

<Callout type="info">
	The `no_reasoning` parameter only works with auto routing (`"model": "auto"`).
	If no non-reasoning models are available that meet your request requirements,
	the API will return an error.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
	Auto routing analyzes your payload and automatically chooses between
	cost-effective models for simple requests and more powerful models for complex
	or large-context requests.
</Callout>

### Coming Soon: Advanced Optimization

We're continuously improving our auto routing capabilities. Soon you'll benefit from:

- **Tool call optimization**: Automatically select models that excel at function calling and structured outputs
- **Content-aware routing**: Analyze message content to determine the best model for specific types of requests (coding, creative writing, analysis, etc.)
- **Performance-based routing**: Route based on historical performance data for similar requests
- **Multi-model orchestration**: Intelligently combine multiple models for complex workflows

### How It Works

1. **Request Analysis**: The system analyzes your request including message content, context size, and any special parameters
2. **Model Selection**: Based on the analysis, it selects the most appropriate model considering cost, performance, and capabilities
3. **Transparent Routing**: Your request is seamlessly routed to the chosen model and provider
4. **Optimized Response**: You receive the best possible response while maintaining cost efficiency

<Callout type="info">
	Auto routing decisions are transparent in your usage logs, so you can always
	see which model was selected for each request.
</Callout>
